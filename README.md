Stock Price Prediction 

Our team participated in a Data Analytics hackathon competition. The case was about conducting EDA and building a prediction model (ARIMA , LSTM) for the stock price of Hoa Phat company. 
In EDA part, I cared about the seasonality, moving average, and trend in the stock price. Other external factors including market trend, Covid-19, global economy,.. were also taken into account for better understanding of the changes in the stock price. 
This case is a very tricky one since its training data is within 3 years period and the test size is 1 year. We used the conventional way to split the data into a training and scoring set. However, after experimenting with several parameters and even the hyper tuning, it still suffered from overfitting and underfitting. 
I believe that the problem was related to the data itself and also how to find better way to split the data. 

I'm looking forward detailed feedbacks and efficient solution from you guys!
